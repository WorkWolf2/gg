  # ============================================================
  # RANGE SYSTEM EXPLANATION
  # ============================================================
  # The range system determines how far a nation can recruit cities.
  #
  # PRECEDENCE:
  # 1. If a role has invite_city_range_blocks > 0: uses role-specific range
  # 2. Otherwise: uses base_recruit_range_blocks + bonuses
  #
  # CALCULATION:
  # Effective Range = base_recruit_range_blocks + (number_of_cities - 1) * per_city_bonus_range_blocks
  #
  # EXAMPLE:
  # - base: 1000 blocks
  # - per_city_bonus: 500 blocks
  # - Nation with 3 cities: 1000 + (3-1)*500 = 2000 blocks range
  #
  # If chief role has invite_city_range_blocks: 10000, chief can invite from 10000 blocks
  # If mayor role has invite_city_range_blocks: 0, mayor uses calculated range (2000 blocks)
  # ============================================================
  range:
    base_recruit_range_blocks: 1000
    per_city_bonus_range_blocks: 500

  diplomacy:
    pacts:

      # When false: pacts don't prevent overclaiming
      block_overclaim_between_partners: true

  # ============================================================
  # OVERCLAIM SYSTEM EXPLANATION
  # ============================================================
  # This setting controls whether nations can overclaim OTHER nations' territory.
  # This is SEPARATE from HypingTeams' overclaim system.
  #
  # enabled: true  = Nations CAN overclaim other nations (unless blocked by pacts)
  # enabled: false = Nations CANNOT overclaim other nations at all
  #
  # NOTE: HypingTeams overclaim (lost claims) still works independently.
  # This only affects nation-to-nation overclaiming.
